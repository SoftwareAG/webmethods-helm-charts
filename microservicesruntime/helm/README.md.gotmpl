# webMethods Microservices Runtime Helm Chart

This Helm Chart installs and configures a Microservices Runtime (MSR) container. It is starting with a simple example and provides more complex scenarios in the *Examples for Use-cases* section.

## Prerequisites

### Image Pull Secret

If you want to pull image from [Software AG Containers Registry](https://containers.softwareag.com), create secret with your Software AG Containers Registry credentials ...

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=sagcr.azurecr.io --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pwd> --docker-email=<your-email>
```

### Service Monitor

A Service Monitor CRD can be created optional. Anywhere, the custom kind `ServiceMonitor` must be registered as Kubernetes object. If not, you can apply it with ...

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml
```

### Create Image for Microservices Runtime

The default is to pull the image from Software AG Containers Registry `sagcr.azurecr.io/webmethods-microservicesruntime`.

If you need to create an own image with additional webMethods product components, you can use the utility [image-creator-using-Azure-DevOps](../../utils/image-creator-using-azure-devops/README.md). On starting the pipeline, you can define a list of product components. You should set in field `List of product components ...` the value `MSC,PIEContainerExternalRDBMS` (as minimum) to create an image with product Microservices Runtime and Database Drivers to connect external databases.

### Licenses

Microservices Runtime requires a license file. These license is supposed to be provided as configmap. If you want to omit the license key 
because you are using a trial image or an image with a baked-in license key, use:

```
--set microservicesruntime.licenseKeyProvided=false
```

If you do not set this flag to false, this helm charts expects a license key provided via configmap. Create the license key configmap as follows:

```
kubectl create configmap microservicesruntime-license-key --from-file=licensekey=<your path and filename to Microservices Runtime license file>
```

Optionally you can also provide the license directly when installing your release (see also below).

## Examples for Use-cases

## Install Microservices Runtime Release

Install release with pulling image and setting secret (to pull image) ...

```shell
helm install wm-msr webmethods/microservicesruntime   \
```

... (optionally) provide the license key at installation time (can be ommitted for upgrade later) ...

```shell
--set-file=license=<your path and filename to Microservices Runtime license file> \
```

... set your own image pull secret if you didn't create the default `regcred` ... 

```shell
--set "imagePullSecrets[0].name=your-registry-credentials" \
```

... Ingress is enabled per default. Define Ingress service host ...

```shell
  --set "ingress.hosts[0].host=my-msr.mydomain.com"   \
  --set "ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].path=/"            \
  --set "ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].pathType=Prefix"   \
  --set "ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].port=5555"
```

... instead of using default image, use your own ...

```shell
  --set "image.repository=<Your-Docker-registry>/wm-msr-db" \
  --set "image.tag=10.15"
```

## Version History

| Version | Changes and Description |
|-----|------|
| `1.0.1` | Initial release |
| `1.0.2` | Added new option `microservicesruntime.licenseKeyProvided` to allow using images with trial or baked-in license key |
| `1.0.3` | Make Liveness and Readiness Probes as per current default. Both can now also be overwritten in a custom values file `values.yaml`. |
| `1.0.4` | Option in `values.yaml` to create a ServiceMonitor added. Some errors in Nginx external LB corrected |
