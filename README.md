## Available Charts READMEs

Each chart has a README for *how to use* and lists some prerequisites.

| [developerportal](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-helm-charts/blob/main/developerportal/helm/README.md) | webMethods Developer Portal |
| [microservicesruntime](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-helm-charts/blob/main/microservicesruntime/helm/README.md) | Microservices Runtime (MSR) |
| [mywebmethodsserver](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-helm-charts/blob/main/mywebmethodsserver/helm/README.md) | My webMethods Server (MWS) |

## Chart Versions

Per default, Helm uses the latest version on release installation. If you have successfully installed a webMethods release, you should notice the current used Chart version. Therefore, on further release installation or upgrades (with `helm upgrade --install`) you should use the `--version X.Y.Z` to guarantee that the same is installed everywhere.
